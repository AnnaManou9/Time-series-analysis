# Time-series-analysis
Project outside of the course scope dealing with time-series data analysis. It consists of analysing light curves from supernovae, basically the intensity change in time. The project also consists of the modelling of the light curves using the MOSFiT library that fits and predicts physical parameters based on the available data.
